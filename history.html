		<h1>History of labrador</h1>
		<p>
			in Newfoundland, were first introduced to Britain from ships trading between Canada and Poole in Dorset. These were then bred with British hunting dogs to create what became known as the Labrador Retriever. Its early patrons included the Earl of Malmesbury, the Duke of Buccleuch, the Earl of Home, and Sir John Scott. Early writers have confused the Labrador with the much larger Newfoundland and the Lesser Newfoundland, with Charles St. John even referring to the Lesser Newfoundland as the Newfoundland. Colonel Peter Hawker describes the first Labrador as being not larger than an English Pointer, more often black than other colours, long in its head and nose with a deep chest, fine legs, and short and smooth coat, and did not carry its tail as highly as the Newfoundland.[5] Hawker distinguishes the Newfoundland from both the "proper Labrador" and St. John's breed of these dogs[5][6] in the fifth edition of his book Introductions to Young Sportsman, published in 1846.[6]

			A photograph taken in 1857 shows the Earl of Home's dog "Nell", described both as a Labrador and a St. John's water dog.[citation needed] By 1870 the name Labrador Retriever had become common in England.[7] The liver (now usually called chocolate) Labrador emerged in the late 1800s, with liver-coloured pups documented at the Buccleuch kennels in 1892;[8] the first yellow Labrador on record was born in 1899 (Ben of Hyde, kennels of Major C.J. Radclyffe).[citation needed] The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1903.[9] The first American Kennel Club (AKC) registration was in 1917.[10]
